# environmet_impact_of_food_production

This is a small project to refresh my R programming knowledge. The goal of this projecct is to analyse the environment impact of foodproduction and finding sustainable diet with low environment impact.
 
 The data for this project is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selfvivek/environment-impact-of-food-production . 
 
 I tried to answer the following questions using the dataset I had: 
* Which types of food have more negative impact on the environment?
* What types of food production should be encouraged to consume nutritious diet in a sustainable way?
* Which stage of food production contributes more to the greenhouse gas emmision?
* Compare carbon footprint of plant-based foods?
* Compare carbon footprint of animal-based foods?
* Compare carbon footprint of protein rich foods?

Please check out the rendered HTML or PDF documents to see the results of my analysis for answering these questions.
